\title{
Predicting context-specific m6A regulation of gene expression
}
\description{
The package is designed to predict genes whose expressions are regulaed by m6A methylation based on a negative binomial regression model with pooling prior information across genes to explicitly estimate the sample-to-sample variability between biological replicates and improve the precision and robustness of regression coefficients, which is suitable for MeRIP-seq data in small sample scenario.

\details{
In order to analysis the regulation of m6A methylation on gene expression, we develop the R package m6A-express. The inputs of m6A-express are BAM files of RNA-seq data or INPUT BAM files of MeRIP-seq data, which are used to quantify gene expression, and IP BAM files with paired INPUT BAM files that are used to quantify methylation inensity in m6A-express model. For the origianl gene annotation file, such as GTF or TXDB format file, user could provide it or directly use the default in-built annotation file by given the function parameter \code{species}, \code{annot_type}, \code{GENOME} and \code{UCSC_TABLE_NAME = "knownGene"}.

The \code{m6Aexpress} function is an all-in-one command that performs all the core functions of the m6A-express R-package. The core function of \code{m6A_express} achieved two modes to predict methylation regulated expression genes:

1. Predict m6A regulated expression genes under multiple conditions, such as in mutiple tissues context, and we call it \code{basic} mode.

2. Predict the differential methylation peak sites regulated differential expression genes in specific context and we call it \code{DE-DM} mode.

}
\value{
In the \code{basic} mode, m6A-express will output results in specific directory including:

1. Peak calling result botain by \code{exomePeak} R-package, which are detailedly explained in \code{exomePeak} R-package.

2. The paired reads count and methylation intensity for each gene in tab-delimited text file.

3. The predicting m6A methylation regulated expression (m6A-reg-exp) genes under given cut-off in .XLS (tab-delimited) format file. The .XLS file includes five columns: the name of m6A-reg-exp gene, Beta0, Beta1, pvalue and FDR.
 \item{gene_name}{The name of m6A methylation regulated expression gene in the given annotation file.}
 \item{Beta0}{Beta0 is a gene-specific intercept and models the baseline log gene expression.}
 \item{Beta1}{Beta1 captures the influence of m6A methylation on gene expression.}
 \item{pvalue}{pvalue of the predicted m6A-reg-exp genes.}
 \item{FDR}{FDR of the predicted m6A-reg-exp genes.}

In the \code{DE-DM} mode, m6A-express will output results in specific directory including:

1. Consistent peak sites information between two conditions obtained by \code{exomePeak} R-package, which are detailedly explained in \code{exomePeak} R-package.

2. Differential expression (DE) gene as .XLS file on disk in the specified directory given DE cut-off (e.g. \code{diff_gene_pvalue=0.05} or \code{diff_gene_fdr=0.05}).

3. The differential m6A methylation (DM) peak sites information saved as .XLS file in the specified directory given DM cut-off (e.g. \code{diff_peak_pvalue=0.05} or \code{diff_peak_fdr=0.05}).

4. The paired reads count and methylation intensity for each differential expression gene with differential methylation peaks (DE-DM) in tab-delimited text file.

5. The predicting m6A methylation regulated expression (m6A-reg-exp) genes out from DE-DM genes under given cut-off (e.g. \code{pvalue=0.05} or \code{FDR=0.05}) in .XLS (tab-delimited) format file. The .XLS file includes five columns: the name of m6A-reg-exp gene, Beta0, Beta1, pvalue and FDR.
